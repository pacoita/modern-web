# modern-web

This project is an examples gallery showing the usage of some modern browser APIs in practical examples. 

## Demo

You can test the different APIs at: https://pacoita.github.io/modern-web/home

⚠️ &nbsp; The browser support is displayed at the bottom of each API page. 
Keep in mind that, being some APIs still in an experimental phase, you might need Chrome and to enable some `Chrome-flags` to test them properly. In each API description is reported all what you need to enable for testing.

## PWA Capabilities

The application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), installable on your device. 

On **desktop machines** you can install the app locally by clicking in the *install* icon in the browser address bar (the image below shows the icon in Chrome):

</p> 

Accessing the app with a **mobile device**, you should be automatically prompted to add the application to your device home screen.

If you are interested in learning more about PWAs, have a look at my [PWA course](https://www.educative.io/courses/zero-to-hero-with-progressive-web-apps) or [other topics](https://www.educative.io/profile/view/5884426195042304) on the Educative.org portal.
